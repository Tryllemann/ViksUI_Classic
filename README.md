ViksUI is a fully functional UI replacement for WOW with many extra features that are not included in the standard UI. Almost everything can easy be changed ingame. Panels and borders can be changed color on, or turn off.

## How to install
* Download it from [WowInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info21462-ViksUI.html#info)
* Download it from [Curse/Twitch](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/viksui)

Grab the latest files from github here: [Latest](https://github.com/Tryllemann/ViksUI/archive/master.zip)
Download and unzip it to your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` directory.

Close the game before moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.
